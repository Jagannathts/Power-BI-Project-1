# Power-BI-Project-1
Indian Premier League (IPL)
This project is based on IPL. I created this project to showcase the full match details on a single page.


Raw data containing matches and deliveries merged in Power BI and created an interactive dashboard containing full cricket match details. Match details including all relevant details of a particular match could be obtained by selecting the match number. Dax functions used. The dashboard will have team’s total batting team’s runs, match number, extras, batmen runs, button to select two playing teams, batting run rate, bowler run rate, and scorecard.
